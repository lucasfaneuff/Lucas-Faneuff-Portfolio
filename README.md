# Customer Segment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail food company's customer base to uncover behavioural patterns and segment customers using the RFM framework. The goal is to help marketing and strategy teams improve business decisions, better understand customer value, improve retention, and guide targeted outreach.

The analysis includes end-to-end data work: cleaning, transforming, SQL queries, customer clustering logic, and a Power BI dashboard for interactive insight exploration.

## 🧠 Business Problem

The company had uniform treatment of the customer base leading to:
- Poor retention among high value segment

- No understanding of purchasing patterns

The projects solves this through identification of customer segments and further recommended actions for each group
